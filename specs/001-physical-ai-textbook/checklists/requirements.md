# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — An AI-Native Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](D:/Q4_hackathon/specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **NOTE**: Not applicable. This is a technical specification where implementation details are required.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - **NOTE**: Not applicable. The target audience for this specification is technical.
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - **NOTE**: Not applicable. Success criteria are tied to the specific technical stack.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - **NOTE**: These are implicitly identified and will be formally documented in the plan.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - **NOTE**: Not applicable. This is a technical specification.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
