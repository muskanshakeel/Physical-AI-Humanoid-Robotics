# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Chapter 2: Tooling

## 1. Concepts

This chapter focuses on the specific tooling and file formats used to create and interact with simulated robots and environments in Gazebo and Unity. We will cover:

-   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: A detailed look at URDF for describing robot kinematics and dynamics.
-   **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: Understanding SDF for describing environments, robots, and various simulation properties.
-   **Gazebo Tools**: Key Gazebo tools such as `gzclient`, `gzserver`, and `gzmodel` for managing simulations and models.
-   **Unity Robotics Hub**: Overview of Unity's dedicated tools and packages for robotics development.
-   **ROS 2 Integration**: How ROS 2 communicates with Gazebo and Unity, specifically through plugins and client libraries.

## 2. Tooling: Gazebo and Unity Ecosystem

This section will detail the practical usage of:

-   **Gazebo**: Launching, manipulating models, and integrating with ROS 2 via plugins.
-   **Unity**: Setting up a robotics project, importing robot models (e.g., from URDF), and configuring sensor simulations.
-   **URDF/SDF Parsers**: Tools and libraries for processing and generating robot and world descriptions.

## 3. Implementation walkthrough

A step-by-step guide to importing a URDF model into Gazebo and publishing its joint states to ROS 2.

## 4. Case study / example

A case study on creating a custom Gazebo world with a specific sensor setup.

## 5. Mini project

A hands-on project to import a robot model from URDF into Unity and control it using a simple ROS 2 interface.

## 6. Debugging & common failures

Common issues encountered when integrating URDF/SDF models, configuring simulation plugins, or establishing communication between ROS 2 and simulation environments.
