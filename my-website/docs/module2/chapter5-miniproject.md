# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Chapter 5: Mini Project

## 1. Concepts

This mini-project challenges you to create a dynamic simulated environment where a robot can interact with objects. You will apply your knowledge of model loading, physics simulation, and basic control to achieve specific environmental interactions.

<h2> 2. Tooling</h2>

We will primarily use Gazebo or Unity, a text editor, and ROS 2 for robot control and interaction.

<h2> 3. Implementation Walkthrough</h2>

This section will provide high-level guidance for the mini-project, assuming you will fill in the details based on previous chapters.

<h2> 4. Case study / example</h2>

A case study on simulating a robot pushing a box across a surface.

<h2> 5. Mini Project: Environment Interaction</h2>

The goal of this mini-project is to develop a simulation scenario where a robot performs a basic interaction with its environment.

<h3> Project Objective</h3>

-   Create a simple environment (e.g., a table with a block) in Gazebo or Unity.
-   Integrate a robot (e.g., a simple manipulator or mobile robot) into this environment.
-   Implement a control strategy for the robot to interact with the object (e.g., push it, pick it up and place it somewhere else, or navigate around it).

<h3> Validation</h3>

-   The robot successfully interacts with the object as intended.
-   Physics simulation behaves realistically during the interaction.

<h2> 6. Debugging & common failures</h2>

Common issues in environment interaction, such as unstable physics leading to objects flying away, incorrect collision detection, or failures in robot control during interaction.
