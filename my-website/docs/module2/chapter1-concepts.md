# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Chapter 1: Concepts

## 1. Concepts: Introduction to Digital Twins and Simulation

This chapter introduces the concept of digital twins in robotics and the role of simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity. We will cover:

-   **Digital Twins**: Definition, purpose, and benefits in robotics development.
-   **Robotics Simulation**: Why simulate? Advantages and limitations.
-   **Gazebo Basics**: Introduction to Gazebo, its architecture, and common use cases for ROS 2 integration and physics simulation.
-   **Unity Basics**: Introduction to Unity, its High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), and its strengths for advanced rendering and complex sensor simulation.
-   **Physics Simulation**: Core principles of physics engines in simulation environments, including collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and joint mechanics.

## 2. Tooling

This section will introduce the installation and basic setup of Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation.

## 3. Implementation walkthrough

A step-by-step guide to launching a basic simulated robot in Gazebo.

## 4. Case study / example

A case study on simulating a sensor (e.g., a LiDAR) in Unity and visualizing its output.

<h2> 5. Mini project</h2>

A hands-on project to create a simple virtual environment in Gazebo with movable objects and a robot.

## 6. Debugging & common failures

Common issues encountered in robotics simulation, such as physics instabilities, model loading errors, or performance bottlenecks.
