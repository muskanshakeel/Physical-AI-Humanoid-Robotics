# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Chapter 2: Tooling

## 1. Concepts

This chapter will focus on the practical tools used in ROS 2 development, building on the concepts introduced in Chapter 1. We will explore how to interact with ROS 2 systems using command-line interfaces and visualization tools.

## 2. Tooling: Essential ROS 2 Commands

This section will cover the essential ROS 2 command-line tools:

-   `ros2 run`: For launching ROS 2 nodes.
-   `ros2 topic`: For inspecting and interacting with ROS 2 topics (e.g., `ros2 topic list`, `ros2 topic echo`, `ros2 topic pub`).
-   `ros2 service`: For inspecting and interacting with ROS 2 services (e.g., `ros2 service list`, `ros2 service call`).
-   `ros2 param`: For managing node parameters.
-   `rviz`: The 3D visualization tool for ROS 2.
-   `rqt_graph`: A GUI tool for visualizing the ROS 2 computation graph.

## 3. Implementation walkthrough

A step-by-step guide to using the ROS 2 command-line tools to inspect a running ROS 2 system.

## 4. Case study / example

A case study on using `rviz` to visualize sensor data from a simulated robot.

## 5. Mini project

A hands-on project to create a custom RQT plugin for monitoring a ROS 2 system.

## 6. Debugging & common failures

Common issues encountered when using ROS 2 tools and how to resolve them.
