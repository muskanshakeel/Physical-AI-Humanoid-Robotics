# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Chapter 1: Concepts

## 1. Concepts: Introduction to ROS 2

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, the Robotic Operating System, which serves as the backbone for robotic applications. We will cover:

-   **rclpy**: The Python client library for ROS 2.
-   **Nodes**: The basic unit of computation in ROS 2.
-   **Topics**: The main mechanism for asynchronous, many-to-many data exchange.
-   **Services**: Request/reply interaction for synchronous communication.
-   **Actions**: Long-running goal-based tasks with feedback.
-   **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML format for describing robots.

## 2. Tooling

This section will introduce basic ROS 2 command-line tools for interacting with nodes, topics, and services.

## 3. Implementation walkthrough

A step-by-step guide to creating a simple ROS 2 node.

## 4. Case study / example

A more advanced example, such as controlling a simple robotic arm with ROS 2.

## 5. Mini project

A hands-on project for the reader to implement, focusing on basic mobile robot navigation.

## 6. Debugging & common failures

Common issues encountered when working with ROS 2 and how to debug them.
