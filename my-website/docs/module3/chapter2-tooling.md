# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Chapter 2: Tooling

## 1. Concepts

This chapter focuses on the practical setup and utilization of NVIDIA's Isaac platform for robotics, including the necessary hardware (Jetson) and software components. We will cover the prerequisites and initial configuration steps to get an Isaac development environment operational.

## 2. Tooling: Setting Up Your Isaac Environment

This section will detail the practical usage and setup of:

-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim Installation**: Step-by-step guide to installing Isaac Sim, including Omniverse Launcher and necessary extensions.
-   **Isaac ROS Setup**: How to install and configure Isaac ROS packages within a ROS 2 workspace.
-   **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Setup**:
    -   **Hardware Setup**: Initial physical setup of the Jetson Orin Nano/NX.
    -   **JetPack Installation**: Installing NVIDIA JetPack SDK, which includes the OS, CUDA, cuDNN, and TensorRT, essential for accelerated AI workloads on the Jetson.
    -   **ROS 2 on Jetson**: Configuring a ROS 2 environment on the Jetson platform.
-   **USD Composer**: Introduction to USD Composer for scene editing and asset management within the Omniverse ecosystem.

## 3. Implementation walkthrough

A step-by-step guide to launching a basic example simulation in Isaac Sim and verifying Isaac ROS installation.

<h2> 4. Case study / example</h2>

A case study on porting a basic ROS 2 node from a desktop environment to a Jetson Orin and verifying its performance.

<h2> 5. Mini project</h2>

A hands-on project to create a simple custom USD asset in Blender and import it into Isaac Sim.

<h2> 6. Debugging & common failures</h2>

Common issues encountered during Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS installation, Jetson setup (e.g., driver issues, environment configuration), or performance bottlenecks on the edge device.
