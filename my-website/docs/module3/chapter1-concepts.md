# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Chapter 1: Concepts

## 1. Concepts: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac for Robotics AI

This chapter introduces the NVIDIA Isaac platform, a comprehensive toolkit for AI-driven robotics. We will explore key concepts that enable advanced perception, navigation, and manipulation capabilities for robots. We will cover:

-   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Introduction to the robotics simulation platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, focusing on its features for photorealistic rendering, accurate physics, and extensive sensor simulation.
-   **Isaac ROS**: Understanding Isaac ROS, a collection of hardware-accelerated packages for ROS 2 that leverage NVIDIA GPUs for AI and robotics workloads.
-   **Omniverse USD (Universal Scene Description)**: The open-source, extensible scene description used by Isaac Sim, enabling collaborative workflows and complex scene representations.
-   **VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: Concepts behind using visual sensors (cameras) to simultaneously build a map of an unknown environment and localize the robot within that map.
-   **Nav2 Basics**: Introduction to the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2), its architecture, and how it enables autonomous navigation for mobile robots.

## 2. Tooling

This section will introduce the installation and basic setup of NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Isaac ROS.

<h2> 3. Implementation walkthrough</h2>

A step-by-step guide to launching a basic simulated robot in Isaac Sim.

<h2> 4. Case study / example</h2>

A case study on using Isaac ROS for VSLAM in a simulated environment.

<h2> 5. Mini project</h2>

A hands-on project to integrate Nav2 with a robot in Isaac Sim for basic autonomous navigation.

<h2> 6. Debugging & common failures</h2>

Common issues encountered when working with NVIDIA Isaac, such as installation problems, simulation performance, or VSLAM accuracy.
